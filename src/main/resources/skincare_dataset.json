The formula improves elasticity, deeply hydrates the skin, and supports natural collagen and elastin synthesis, restoring firmness and a youthful appearance.\n\nThe mask features Volufiline, a French-developed ingredient by Sederma, derived from plant-based saponins extracted from Asian gardenia. It promotes visible contour lifting by stimulating lipid synthesis in the skin.\n\nA premium elastic peptide enhances the anti-wrinkle effect.

Niacinamide strengthens the skin barrier and refreshes tired skin.\n\nThe product is registered in the CPNP (Cosmetic Product Notification Portal) and has been tested for skin safety and soothing properties.\n\nKey ingredients: Fermented Lactobacillus Soy Extract; Adenosine; Tea Tree Leaf Extract; Niacinamide; Mint Extract and Tea Tree Extract; Ionized Water; Tocopherol\n\nComposition/INCI: Sh-Oligopeptide-1, Cypress Leaf Extract, Saccharomyces Ferment / Imperata Cylindrica Root Extract, Peppermint Oil, Hexyl Cinnamal, Privet Fruit Extract, Niacinamide, Ethylhexylglycerin, Caffeoyl Tripeptide-1, Linalool, Trehalose, Dipropylene Glycol, Saccharomyces Ferment / Mistletoe Extract, Holly Leaf Extract, Fragrance, PEG-60 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Tocopherol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Lactobacillus / Soy Ferment Extract, Oregano Leaf Extract, Acetyl Hexapeptide-22, Carbomer, Glycereth-26, Sophora Root Extract, Horsetail Extract, Field Mint Extract, Baikal Skullcap Root Extract, Tea Tree Leaf Oil, Disodium EDTA, Purslane Extract, Butylene Glycol, Anemarrhena Asphodeloides Root Extract, Adenosine, Potassium Glycyrrhizate, Oligopeptide-28, Allantoin, Propanediol, Acetyl Hexapeptide-8, Willow Bark Extract, Alcohol, Hydrogenated Polyisobutene, 1,2-Hexanediol, Japanese Black Pine Leaf Extract, Water, Sodium Chloride, Sh-Octapeptide-4, Sh-Pentapeptide-19, Cinnamon Bark Extract, Arginine, Sh-Decapeptide-7, Glycerin",

The skin around the eyes has fewer sebaceous glands, so it dries out faster, which can accelerate the appearance of fine lines. This area needs both hydration and nourishment—while maintaining balance: too much richness may contribute to milia, and too little may lead to increased dryness and wrinkles.\n\nThis cream has a light herbal scent and is very economical—just a small amount is enough for one side of the face. It can also be used on areas that tend to show early signs of aging, such as the neck, nasolabial folds, and the glabella (between the brows).\n\nFormulated specifically for the thin, delicate eye area, it is suitable for gentle massage to help reduce puffiness.

    "text": "IM'UNNY — Alluring Liquid Shadow\n\nAt first glance, it’s just a liquid eyeshadow. We chose it because of the technology that makes it long-wearing, so you don’t need to touch up eye makeup during the day.\n\nThe secret is in the textures: the creators combined a lightweight oil base with pigmented powder. When applied, the oil binds the powder particles and fixes the product on the lids until you decide to remove it. After application, the oil evaporates without clogging pores, leaving a comfortable creamy finish.\n\nThese shadows won’t let you down: they don’t flake, and they resist sweat and water drops (or tears). The shade in the box is a natural brown, and you can easily adjust intensity by layering.\n\nAnother reason to love it: application takes seconds and you can use your fingers — no special brushes needed. A great option when you’re always on the go.\n\nKey ingredients: Apricot Kernel Oil; Olive Oil; Rosehip Fruit Oil\n\nComposition/INCI: Black Iron Oxide, Argan Oil, Octyldodecanol, Apricot Kernel Oil, Pentaerythrityl Tetra-di-t-butyl Hydroxyhydrocinnamate, Yellow Iron Oxide, Meadowfoam Seed Oil, Olive Oil, Trimethylsiloxysilicate, Triethoxycaprylylsilane, Hexylene Glycol, Isododecane, Talc, Titanium Dioxide, Silica, Phenoxyethanol, Propylene Carbonate, Jojoba Oil, Disteardimonium Hectorite, Yellow Colorant No. 4, Hydrogenated Styrene/Acrylates Copolymer, Aluminum Hydroxide, Dicalcium Phosphate, Caprylyl Glycol, Rosehip Oil, Tocopheryl Acetate",

When you apply it with massaging motions, you get a light scrub effect: it helps lift dead skin cells and break down oil plugs.\n\nThanks to natural oils and extracts, the mask doesn’t fully dry down — meaning it won’t over-dry the skin and can suit even sensitive and dry skin types.\n\nThe mask is free from six common parabens, benzyl alcohol, chlorphenesin, sorbic acid, benzoic acid, and benzophenone-4.\n\nKey ingredients: Chamomile Extract; Damask Rose Extract; Calendula; Kaolin (White Clay)\n\nComposition/INCI: Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria) Flower Water, Lavandula Angustifolia (Lavender) Oil, Coptis Japonica Extract, Azadirachta Indica Leaf Extract, Anthemis Nobilis Flower Powder, Melissa Officinalis Flower/Leaf/Stem Water, Polyglyceryl-10 Myristate, 1,2-Hexanediol, Artemisia Annua Extract, Pulsatilla Koreana Extract, Palmitic Acid, Polyglyceryl-2 Stearate, Usnea Barbata (Lichen) Extract, Zanthoxylum Piperitum Fruit Extract, Butylene Glycol, Citrus Aurantium Dulcis (Orange) Peel Oil, Cetyl Alcohol, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Helichrysum Arenarium Extract, Rosmarinus Officinalis (Rosemary) Leaf Oil, Citrus Aurantium Bergamia (Bergamot) Fruit Oil, Ethylhexylglycerin, Tromethamine, Symphytum Officinale Leaf Extract, Propanediol, Eucalyptus Globulus Leaf Oil, Lavandula Angustifolia (Lavender) Flower Water, Kaolin, Aniba Rosodora (Rosewood) Wood Oil, Rosa Damascena Flower Water, Water, Calendula Officinalis Flower Extract, Calendula Officinalis Flower, Glycerin, Xanthan Gum, Stearic Acid, Stearyl Alcohol, Glyceryl Stearate, Cetyl Ethylhexanoate, Helichrysum Italicum Flower Water",

It helps support a weakened skin barrier and can reduce redness, breakouts, and dryness.\n\nNatural fermented components help protect the skin, which is especially useful during temperature and humidity swings. Because of its clean formula and strong performance, this indie brand became a favorite for many Korean consumers, and the product won a Glowpick beauty award in Korea in 2021.\n\nThe essence has an unusual stretchy texture that can resemble snail mucin. In reality, this comes from fermented beans rich in vitamins and amino acids that support the skin. Despite the texture, it absorbs quickly and doesn’t leave stickiness, making it suitable for oily, combination, and problem-prone skin.\n\nIt helps improve the look of uneven tone, hydrates by supporting moisture retention, and can help reduce excess sebum, which may support fewer clogged pores.\n\nYou can use it as part of a routine with toner and cream, or on its own. It can also be used for facial massage 2–3 times a week.\n\nKey ingredients: Saccharomyces Ferment Filtrate; Fermented Pear Extract; Fermented Soybean Extract\n\nComposition/INCI: Saccharomyces Ferment Filtrate, Lactobacillus/Fermented Soybean Extract, Propanediol, Water, Lactobacillus-Fermented Pomegranate Fruit Extract, Glycerin, Lactobacillus-Fermented Pear Extract",

This мягкий gel based on Jeju yuzu citrus and 12 vitamins deeply cleanses pores, dissolves makeup, and gently exfoliates. Konjac particles and three acids—AHA, PHA, BHA—create the triple эффект.\n\nKonjac gum helps exfoliate effectively, removing the keratinized layer along with water-resistant or evening makeup. The gel also helps with closed comedones by thoroughly cleansing pores and removing leftover dirt and dust. A high content of vitamins and niacinamide helps avoid over-drying; instead, it tones and supports a more even-looking complexion.\n\nThe product has a vegan certificate (no animal-derived ingredients). Suitable for all skin types. To avoid individual reactions, and for sensitive skin, a patch test is recommended.\n\nFun fact: natural ingredients can break down when heated during extraction. To prevent this, the formula uses a cold extraction method: yuzu is soaked in cold water for 24 hours, then gently filtered without pressure or chemical additives—slowly extracting beneficial components while preserving properties.\n\nKey ingredients: Biotin (B7); Pyridoxine (B6); Ethyl Ascorbic Acid; Riboflavin (B2); Panthenol; Niacinamide; AHA; PHA; Tocopherol; BHA\n\nComposition/INCI: Cyanocobalamin, Fragrance, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Niacinamide, Ethylhexylglycerin, Potassium Chloride, Tartrazine, Biotin, Hydrogenated Lecithin, Linalool, Linoleic Acid, Salicylic Acid, Lauryl Glucoside, Riboflavin, Sunset Yellow, Gluconolactone, Glycolic Acid, Panthenol, Limonene, Isopropyl Myristate, Hexylene Glycol, Tocopherol, Yuzu Extract (100 ppm), 3-O-Ethyl Ascorbic Acid, Disodium Cocoamphodiacetate, Disodium EDTA, Green Mandarin Peel Extract, Butylene Glycol, Polyglyceryl-10 Laurate, Pyridoxine, Glucomannan, Folic Acid, Thiamine Hydrochloride, Sodium Cocoyl Isethionate, Methyl Perfluorobutyl Ether, 1,2-Hexanediol, Potassium Cocoyl Glycinate, Water, Acrylate Copolymer, Sodium Chloride, Sodium Ascorbyl Phosphate, Yuzu Seed Oil (100 ppm), Tromethamine, Glycerin, Formic Acid, Beta-Carotene",

This cream’s name promises what it delivers—a visible “wow” effect. It is designed to brighten and restore elasticity in delicate zones where aging often starts first.\n\nIt also targets pigmentation. With multiple forms of hyaluronic acid, it hydrates deeply, nourishes, and helps restore the skin’s hydrolipid balance.\n\nOne of the main advantages is the presence of epidermal growth factors (4GF)—proteins that support renewal, growth, and cell division, and help promote collagen synthesis. This means wrinkle care happens not only at the surface level but also at the cellular level. Volufiline and thiotaurine work together to reduce wrinkle depth, smooth expression lines, and help densify the thin, sensitive eye-area skin.\n\nMost ingredients carry EWG GREEN ratings (excluding natural extracts).

    "text": "IM'UNNY — Fake Trick Double Eyeliner\n\nMany people think eyeliner is only for dramatic, Old-Hollywood wings. Then you discover IM'UNNY Fake Trick Double Eyeliner and realize it deserves a place in any makeup bag—especially for those who prefer natural, quick makeup.\n\nThis is a nude-toned liner designed to enhance the eyes and subtly adjust contours for a more refined look. Its signature use is creating the aegyo-sal effect under the lower lid (a soft, youthful highlight line). In Korean, “aegyo-sal” translates as “smiling eyes.”\n\nYou can also use it on the upper lid as the brand suggests—especially effective for those with a less-defined upper crease. The shade and fine brush are also great for trendy faux freckles.\n\nIt’s versatile beyond the eye area: apply along the bridge of the nose or around the nostrils for a subtle contour, highlight collarbones, or use on very light brows to define hairs.\n\nComposition/INCI: Ethylhexylglycerin, Portulaca Extract, Disodium EDTA, Aloe Leaf Extract, Diphenyl Dimethicone, Triethylhexanoin, Octanediol, CI 17200 (Red 33), Diethylhexyl Sodium Sulfosuccinate, CI 19140 (Yellow 5), Phenoxyethanol, Marshmallow Extract, Cynanchum Atratum Extract, Aminomethyl Propanol, Hydrolyzed Lecithin, Laminaria Japonica Extract, 2-Hexanediol, Octylacrylamide/Acrylate Copolymer, Diglycerin, Butylene Glycol, Pentylene Glycol, Glycine Soja (Soybean) Germ Extract, Water, Acrylate Copolymer, CI 42090 (Blue 1), Alcohol Denat., Glycerin, Hydrolyzed Keratin, Laureth-25.",

    "text": "SUR.MEDIC+ — Azulene Mild UV Tone-Up Sun Primer\n\nHydration, and more hydration—especially if you’re planning to wear makeup. That’s why this edition includes a multifunctional 2-in-1 sun primer. The high protection level (SPF50+ PA++++) helps shield skin from UV exposure, while the creamy formula preps the skin for makeup.\n\nIt works like a makeup base: it absorbs quickly, helps foundation apply more evenly, and improves wear time. The lightweight texture with a subtle purple tone helps visually even out the complexion and add a natural glow—purple-toned bases are often used to neutralize dullness and the look of uneven pigmentation.\n\nThe non-pilling, dewy finish also supports the popular Korean “glass skin” look—skin that appears clean, smooth, and naturally radiant.\n\nUV filters are generally divided into mineral (physical) and chemical. Mineral filters sit on the skin and help reflect/deflect UV rays. Chemical filters absorb UV energy and convert it, and in the process they can degrade.\n\nThis primer is built around mineral UV protection with Titanium Dioxide. Titanium Dioxide is a mineral-origin white pigment that is generally considered non-toxic, does not penetrate into the skin, and is associated with a low risk of irritation, which is why mineral filters are often used in products for sensitive skin.\n\nClinical hypoallergenic testing was conducted at a skin research center in Seoul. In a two-month study (participants aged 19–59), the irritation index reached 0.00, supporting low-irritation use, including for sensitive facial skin.\n\nThe formula also helps calm and deeply hydrate irritated skin, supported by a high amount of azulene.\n\nKey ingredients: Lemon Extract; Guaiazulene; Centella Asiatica; Bifida Ferment Lysate; Hyaluronic Acid; Ceramide NP\n\nComposition/INCI: Fragrance, C20-22 Alkyl Phosphate, Tocopherols, Peppermint Oil, Pentylene Glycol, Sodium Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Niacinamide, Ethylhexylglycerin, Phytosphingosine, Ammonium Acryloyldimethyltaurate/VP Copolymer, Hydrogenated Lecithin, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Ceramide AP, Cholesterol, Prunus Serrulata Flower Extract, Behenyl Alcohol, Panthenol, Potassium Sorbate, Guaiazulene (500 ppm), tert-Butyl Alcohol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Terminalia Ferdinandiana (Kakadu Plum) Extract, Caprylyl/Capryl Glucoside, Stearic Acid, Brassica Oleracea (Broccoli) Extract, Ceramide AS, Calendula Officinalis Extract, Methylpropanediol, Ethylhexyl Triazone, Hydroxypropyl Cyclodextrin, Bifida Ferment Lysate, Moringa Oleifera Extract, Disodium EDTA, Portulaca Oleracea Extract, Butylene Glycol, Hyaluronic Acid, Titanium Dioxide, Adenosine, Ceramide NP, Glyceryl Stearate, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Propanediol, Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate, Alcohol, 1,2-Hexanediol, Water, Cetearyl Alcohol, Polyacrylate Crosspolymer-6, Dicaprylyl Carbonate, Tromethamine, Dibutyl Adipate, Butyloctyl Salicylate, Arbutin, Lavender Extract, Polyisobutene, C20-22 Alcohols, Centella Asiatica Extract, Glycerin, Sorbitan Oleate, Ceramide EOP, Glutathione, Ceramide NS, Hydrolyzed Hyaluronic Acid",

To enhance the effect, apply a generous moisturizer after each session.",
